Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the Development and maintainance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintainance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry as stated below:
- it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various  aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.
- driving economic growth: from startups to tech giants effective software engineering practices are essential for business success.
- it enables the creation if systems that automated the process reducing manual work and increasing efficiencies across industries.
- it provides methodologies like Agile, Waterfall,  and devops which are crucial for managing large teams and complex projects.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- the development of the programming languages eg Fortran, c
- the establishment of software engineer as a discipline 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
