#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the Development and maintainance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintainance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry as stated below:
- it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various  aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.
- driving economic growth: from startups to tech giants effective software engineering practices are essential for business success.
- it enables the creation if systems that automated the process reducing manual work and increasing efficiencies across industries.
- it provides methodologies like Agile, Waterfall,  and devops which are crucial for managing large teams and complex projects.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- the development of the programming languages eg Fortran, c
- the establishment of software engineer as a discipline in 1960
- the advent of structural programming in the 1970s
- the rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software development life cycle consists of:
- requirements
- design
- implantation
- testing
- deployment
- maintainance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: sequentially approach with distinct phases
- agile: itirative and increamental approach 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- software developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions 
- quality assurance engineer: ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
- project manager: oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- integrated and development environment: software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code
- version control systems: software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among teammembers eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- changing requirements
- tight deadlines
- technical debt


strategies for overcoming challenges 
- effective communication
- Agile methodologies
- prioritization of tasks
- regular reassessment of project goals and timeliness 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit
- integration
- acceptance 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response 
from airport models.

Importance 
- makes your question clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
